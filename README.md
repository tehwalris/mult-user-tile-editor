# Vertiled

Vertiled is a collaborative online editor for tile-based worlds that we ([Moritz Schneider](https://github.com/bazumo), me and a few others) hacked together during [rc3](https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/). It supports maps in the [Tiled (TMX) map format](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/), but only a subset of their features. The tile rendering is done by (a slightly modified) [gl-tiled](https://github.com/englercj/gl-tiled). The name is a play on the German word "verteilt", which means "distributed".

## Demo

You can try a [**demo instance here**](https://vertiled.do.walr.is/).

## Controls

There is a list of layers on the right side. **Only the selected layer is edited**. If nothing is happening, you probably have the wrong layer selected.

The default tool is clone. Select an area by dragging with the right mouse button, move your mouse to position the selected tiles, then left click to place a copy.

There is an erase tool. Switch to it using the button in the top right corner. Left click to erase.

You can add totally new tiles using the tilesets in the right sidebar. Use the dropdown to choose a tileset. Select some tiles from the tileset preview area by dragging with the left mouse button. Now you can paste these tiles by clicking on the main map (just like when you clone tiles).

## Getting started

### Initial setup

You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (we used v15) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1) on your system.

### Running for development

Start the following commands, with each line in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd gl-tiled && yarn watch
cd vertiled-shared && yarn build --watch
cd vertiled-server && yarn build --watch
cd vertiled-server && nodemon -w dist dist/index.js
cd vertiled-client && yarn start
```

This will start the frontend (most likely) on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) and the server on [localhost:8088](localhost:8088).

### Running in production

**This project is not for serious public deployments**. It is something we quickly hacked together, so it is only suitable for using with a group of friends. There is no access control or secure separation of users built in, so you should deploy this application only on your local network or behind a VPN. You might want to add a proxy server in front for authentication and HTTPS.

To run it locally:

```bash
yarn
yarn workspaces run build
cd vertiled-server
node dist/index.js
```

or via docker:

```bash
docker build -t vertiled .
docker run -p 80:5000 vertiled:latest
```
